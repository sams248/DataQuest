Abraham Lincoln High School is a community where all members help one another pursue their potential. Through our partnership with Johns Hopkins University's Talent Development High Schools, we offer Small Learning Communities (SLC). Our ninth and tenth grade Academies feature a block schedule in which teams of teachers meet with guidance counselors to discuss and support each student's academic performance and socio-emotional development. The first two years at Lincoln are dedicated to meeting high school graduation requirements, while the junior and senior years in the upper academies are devoted to college and career readiness in the sciences or humanities. Lincoln provides students with the individualized attention of SLC, as well as the assets, resources, and facilities of a large comprehensive high school.
